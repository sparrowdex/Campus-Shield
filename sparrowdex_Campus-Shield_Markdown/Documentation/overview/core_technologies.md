# Core Technologies

## Core Technologies

The "Campus-Shield" project by sparrowdex is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance campus security and management. This section outlines the core technologies utilized within the repository, providing developers with the necessary insights to effectively work with the codebase.

### Technology Stack

#### Programming Languages and Versions
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary language used for both frontend and backend development.
- **Python 3.8+**: Utilized for backend services and data processing tasks.

#### Frameworks and Libraries
- **React.js**: Employed for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Utilized for server-side scripting and backend logic.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for API development.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for backend services and RESTful API development.

#### Database Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary relational database system used for storing structured data.
- **MongoDB**: Used for handling unstructured data and providing flexibility in data modeling.

#### Infrastructure and Deployment Tools
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration tool for managing containerized applications across clusters.

### Key Dependencies

#### Essential Packages and Their Purposes
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
- **Redux**: State management library for managing application state in React.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

#### Version Requirements and Compatibility
- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher is recommended for compatibility with the latest features and security updates.
- **React.js**: Version 17.x to ensure compatibility with hooks and concurrent features.
- **Django**: Version 3.2+ for long-term support and security updates.

#### Development vs Production Dependencies
- **Development**: Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and Jest for building, transpiling, linting, and testing the codebase.
- **Production**: Optimized builds with minified assets and environment-specific configurations.

### Development Tools

#### Build Systems and Task Runners
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for compiling JavaScript modules.
- **Gulp**: Task runner for automating repetitive tasks.

#### Testing Frameworks and Tools
- **Jest**: Testing framework for JavaScript with a focus on simplicity.
- **Pytest**: A framework for testing Python applications.

#### Code Quality and Linting Tools
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to ensure consistent code style.

#### Development Environment Setup
- **VSCode**: Recommended IDE with extensions for JavaScript, Python, and Docker.
- **Docker Compose**: For setting up and managing multi-container Docker applications.

### Deployment Stack

#### Server Technologies and Hosting
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy server to handle client requests and serve static files.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosting platform for deploying and scaling the application.

#### CI/CD Pipeline Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD tool for automating the deployment process.

#### Monitoring and Logging Solutions
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring system and time series database.
- **Grafana**: Analytics platform for visualizing metrics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Used for logging and monitoring application performance.

#### Environment Management
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables in development.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely storing and managing sensitive information in production.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the core technologies used in the Campus-Shield project, equipping developers with the knowledge needed to contribute effectively to the codebase.
