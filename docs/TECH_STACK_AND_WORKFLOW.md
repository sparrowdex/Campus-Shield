## MVP Tech Stack (Phase 1)

For the initial MVP, we'll use a simplified but scalable stack:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (flexible schema for reports)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for chat and live updates
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with anonymous options
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for heatmap visualization
- **File Storage**: Local storage initially, cloud storage later
- **AI/ML**: Basic text classification using natural language processing

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. User Onboarding & Authentication
- Users sign up with minimal data, choose anonymity (no personal info required).
- Optional: Offer OAuth (Google, college email) for added features with clear privacy messaging.

### 2. Submitting a Report
- User fills out an easy, privacy-focused incident form (type, location, optional media: photo/video/audio).
- AI categorizes and prioritizes reports (urgency, sentiment).
- Option to join an anonymized support group chat if others report similar issues.
- Location and time data are securely stored.

### 3. Real-Time Features
- Heatmaps display recent incident areas dynamically to users.
- Location-based alerts notify users entering high-report zones.

### 4. Communication & Support
- Option for user-authority anonymous two-way chat (end-to-end encrypted).
- Users can receive automatic resource/counseling referrals based on report context.
- Bystanders can submit related evidence anonymously.

### 5. Gamification and Engagement
- Reward users for reporting, participating in safety polls, or peer support with points/badges.

### 6. Admin & Analytics Tools
- Campus admins access a secure dashboard with:
  - Live incident feed and heatmap.
  - Smart categorization, filtering, and real-time chat tools.
  - Exportable anonymized analytics for transparency.

### 7. Data Privacy and Security
- Anonymous data defaults, strict access logging.
- User control over data retention and auto-deletion timelines.

### 8. Multilingual and Accessibility Support
- Reporting and chat available in multiple languages.
- Accessible UI for all users (WCAG compliance).

## Example User Flow

1. Student opens app, sees incident heatmap.
2. Taps "Report Issue", submits an anonymous report with text/image/location.
3. Receives instant AI-generated confirmation and relevant resource links.
4. Optionally joins a support group or follow-up chat with admin (remains anonymous).
5. Receives status updates or warnings (e.g., "High reports in this area").
6. Admin investigates, resolves, and posts anonymized safety updates.

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MVP (Current Focus)
- Basic user authentication (anonymous + email)
- Incident reporting form with location
- Simple admin dashboard
- Basic heatmap visualization
- MongoDB integration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Real-time chat functionality
- AI-powered categorization
- File upload support
- Advanced analytics
- Push notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Mobile app development
- Advanced AI/ML integration
- Multi-language support
- Advanced security features
- Gamification elements

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- **Data Anonymization**: All personal data is anonymized by default
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For sensitive communications
- **Location Privacy**: Location data is generalized to protect exact coordinates
- **Data Retention**: Automatic deletion policies for old data
- **Access Control**: Strict role-based access for admin features
- **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged for transparency

## Performance & Scalability

- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching
- **CDN**: For static assets and media files
- **Load Balancing**: For high-traffic scenarios
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing and query optimization
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient WebSocket connections

## Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Staging**: Cloud deployment for testing
- **Production**: Scalable cloud infrastructure with monitoring
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
